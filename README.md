# L'Apero du Code homepage - A Gleam Webapp

Collaborative web project for the [L'Apero du Code](https://www.meetup.com/lapero-du-code/) meetup. 

Let's build the homepage for our meetup, design and content is up for debate.

[Gleam](https://gleam.run/) is the language of choice, it's a new language that compiles to JavaScript and Erlang, and it's a great way for everybody to learn something new.

ask for invites from @Ludwig
